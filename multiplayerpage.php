      <p class="Paragraph_text">Multiplayer is the server-based version of Minecraft that enables multiple players to interact with each other on a single world, allowing them to work together to mine ores, build structures, and fight mobs (or each other). Multiplayer works using a server, which allows players to play online or via a local area network with other people. There are various customization options that can be set by operators. These settings depend on the type of server and can create many different multiplayer experiences.
